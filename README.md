For the Beibei dataset execute the command python Beibei.py;
For the Taobao dataset execute the command python Taobao.py.

Since there are no random numbers involved, it is possible to get exactly the same results as in the paper.
In addition, in order to better analyze our model, in this version we do not use GPUs to accelerate and store some intermediate experimental data, which are not needed at all in the real environment.
